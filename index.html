		<p> Course/workwise -I am now doing a python course on Code Academy and learning about lists, just trying to put everything into practice. 
		 Spent today learning about docker and how to get web vunerability aps onto docker. I think that this is an amazing tool. 
		Also spent time doing Burpsuite, and understanding about website application hacking. Taught myself about proxies. 
		That firefox is done on a web setting ,and Chrome is done via the pc.. Also trying to keep up with Tryhackme and Hack the box</.p>
