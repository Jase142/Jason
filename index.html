		<h1> Jason's web page </h1>
		<p> This is my first web page that I have created in a while, so just a fun project </p>
		<p>  Film and TV Smile is a good film to watch... Currently watching Andor with my son.. Great star wars tv series.. Although I am a little lost
		    I think my brother is watching The Peripheral, and I too am enjoying 3 episodes in.
		    I really enjoyed Gangs of London, the second series was a little bit better than the first series in my opinon. </p>
		<nl>
			
		<p>Seen my football team been brought. Well the stadium at least, and the current Chairman Paul Scally staying. Good to see England win 3-0</p>
		<nl>
		<p> Course -I am now doing a python course on Code Academy and learning some Django, in the past week I have learnt some Docker. </p> 
			<p>Had a good day trying to work with Docker, spent most of the morning on Windows, and couldnt get anywhere. But spending
			30 mins on Linux managed to get juice shop on a docker image, and going to the local host on kali linux. Just
				got to remember my elevation with linux sudo bash *** :> <p/>
				
					
		<p>Here is a picture of myself and a man that has been in the news a lot, and idol especially when he played at United first time around<p/>
