		<h1> Jason's web page </h1>
		<p> This is my first web page that I have created in a while, so just a fun project </p>
		<p> Smile is a good film to watch... Currently watching Andor with my son.. Great star wars tv series.. Although I am a little lost
		    I think my brother is watching The Peripheral, and I too am enjoying 3 episodes in.
		    I really enjoyed Gangs of London, the second series was a little bit better than the first series in my opinon. </p>
		<p>As the world cup and FA cup have been on this week. Wanted to discuss my teams.. I went to see Chatham win yesterday 1-0 against
			Littlehampton. Dan Bradshaw scored the only goal in a close game. I also like Gillingham who also draw 1-1 in the FA Cup
			against Dagenham. Ebbsfleet are live on ITV this afternoon also in the FA Cup. And my premier league team is Manchester
			United, who can be a little bit inconsistent like the nation team England. </p>

		<p> I am contemplating on doing a Python programming course. Doing a 7 day trial, I did get the basic understanding of Python
		
			on a youtube course from Michigan. It would be interesting to see on how I develop </p>

			<p>Had a good day trying to work with Docker, spent most of the morning on Windows, and couldnt get anywhere. But spending
			30 mins on Linux managed to get juice shop on a docker image, and going to the local host on kali linux. Just
				got to remember my elevation with linux sudo bash *** :> <p/>
